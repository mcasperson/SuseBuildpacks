Compiling software is not a glamourous job, but it is a critical part of every developer's workflow. The process of compiling software has evolved over the decades moving from developers building artifacts locally, to centralized build servers, to multistage Docker images, and now to a relatively new process called buildpacks.

In this post we'll look at the history of compiling software and see how buildpacks have evolved to provide developers with an opinionated and convenient process for building their source code.

## The history of compiling software

Not so long ago it was common for a developer on a team to perform a release by compiling code on their local workstation, generating deployable artifacts, and performing a deployment using tools like FTP or RDP onto a server. This process had some obvious limitations: it was not reproducible, it was entirely manual, and it depended on an individual's workstation to be properly configured with all the required platforms and scripts required to complete a build.

Build servers, often called Continuous Integration (CI) servers, provided the next logical step. A CI server provided a source of truth where the process of testing and building code was centrally defined and managed. Traditionally, the build process was defined as a series of steps configured through a web console, although more recently those steps are defined as code and checked in alongside the application source code. By automating the process of testing and building code, a CI server allows code changes to be continuously built as a shared Source Control Management (SCM) system received new code commits.

CI servers still require a great deal of specialized configuration though. The Software Development Kits (SDKs) for the various languages must be installed, as well as project and package management tools. Nowadays languages release new versions multiple times a year, which can place a burden on CI servers to maintain multiple SDKs side by side to accommodate software projects that upgrade to new language versions at differing rates. In addition, the CI build steps require a particular CI server to execute them. So even if the step configuration has been expressed as code and checked in alongside the application code, only a particular CI server can execute those steps.

These problems are neatly solved by using Docker. Each Docker image provides an isolated file system, allowing entire build chains to exist within their own independent Docker image. This means even software that has no native support for installing and running multiple versions can exist side by side in their own Docker images. And by using multistage Docker builds, it is possible to define the steps and environment required to build application code with instructions that can be executed by any server or workstation with Docker installed.

The isolated nature of Docker images can present a challenge when building software though. Most applications these days rely on dozens, if not hundreds, of external dependencies that must be downloaded from the internet. A naive implementation of a Docker build script will result in these dependencies being downloaded with each and every build. It is not uncommon for an application to download hundreds of megabytes worth of dependencies, and so without care, compiling applications using Docker can be extremely inefficient.

Still, Docker's ability to precisely define the environment in which an application is built, to allow multiple such definitions to painlessly coexist on a single machine, and to allow builds to be performed anywhere Docker is installed, makes it a very compelling platform to build software in. The only thing missing is the ability to abstract away the highly specialized build processes required to efficiently build software using Docker.

This is where buildpacks come in. A buildpack implements an opinionated build process within a Docker container that takes care of all the fiddly aspects of managing SDKs, caching dependencies, and reducing build times to create an executable Docker image from the supplied source code. This means developers can write their code as they always have, with no Docker build scripts, compile that code with a buildpack, and have their compiled application embedded into an executable Docker image.

Buildpacks are:
* Efficient, as they are specially designed to leverage Docker's functionality to ensure builds are as fast as possible.
* Convenient, as their opinionated workflows require no special knowledge to use, and are trivial to execute.
* Repeatable, requiring only one application to be installed alongside Docker to build any number of languages.
* Flexible, with an open specification allowing anyone to define their own build process.

To demonstrate just how powerful buildpacks are, let's take a typical Java application that has no Docker build configurations and create an executable Docker image with a buidlpack.
